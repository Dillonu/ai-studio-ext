# Rules for Modifying Source Code

- **ALWAYS:** Mention in your response "**Ruleset Applied:** src-rules.mdc" to indicate that this ruleset is in use.
- **ALWAYS:** Think about what the request is, and what you want to accomplish, and how to do it, before modifying any code.

## Coding Style

-   **Braces:** Use braces `{}` for all control flow statements.
    -   Except for single line if statements.
-   **ALWAYS:** Prefer for loops over array methods like forEach, find, etc.

## Angular Rules

-   **ALWAYS:** Every component must have an html, scss, and ts file. Do not combine them.

## Import Style

-   **Grouping (Order):**
    1. Standard Library
    2. External Modules
    3. Internal Modules
    4. Relative Imports (Avoid these, use absolute imports instead)
-   **Alphabetical Ordering:** Within each group, order imports alphabetically.

## Comments

-   **JSDoc:** Use JSDoc for functions, classes, methods, and interfaces. Include `@param`, `@returns`, and `@throws` tags.
-   **Inline Comments:** Explain complex or non-obvious code.
-   **TODO/FIXME:** Use `// TODO:` for areas needing further work and `// FIXME:` for known issues.

## Documentation

-   **Update Documentation:** Reflect code changes in relevant documentation.
-   **README:** Maintain a `README.md` explaining the codebase's purpose and structure.
-   **Doc Rules:** Follow guidelines in [doc-rules.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/doc-rules.mdc).
